        <h1>Equal breathing</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>In the rhythmic dance of breath, we discover a simple yet profound practice known as Equal Breathing. This technique, also referred to as Sama Vritti or Box Breathing, brings equilibrium to the inhale and exhale, fostering a sense of balance and calmness. Whether you're seeking relaxation, stress reduction, or a method to enhance focus, Equal Breathing offers a structured and mindful approach to harnessing the power of your breath. Join us on this journey to find harmony within each inhale and exhale.

            <h3>Steps  for Equal Breathing:
            </h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    Step 1:Find a Comfortable Seat:
                </dt>
                <dd>Sit in a comfortable position, either on the floor with crossed legs or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Ensure your spine is straight, and your shoulders are relaxed.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 2:Relax and Center:
                </dt>
                <dd>Close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so. Take a few natural breaths to settle into the present moment, letting go of any tension in your body.

                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 3:Begin with Exhalation:
                <dd>Start by exhaling completely through your nose. Empty your lungs of air, creating a clear space for the upcoming breath cycle.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 4:Inhale for a Count:
                </dt>
                <dd>Inhale slowly and steadily through your nose, counting to a specific number. A common starting point is to inhale for a count of four, but you can adjust the count based on your comfort and lung capacity.

                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 5:Pause at the Top:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    At the top of your inhalation, briefly pause and hold your breath. This moment of suspension is a key element in equal breathing, contributing to the sense of balance.

                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 6:Exhale for the Same Count:         
                </dt>
                <dd>Exhale smoothly and completely through your nose, matching the count you used for the inhalation. Maintain a controlled and even breath throughout the exhale.
                </dd>
                <dt>Step 7: Pause at the Bottom:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    At the end of your exhalation, pause briefly before beginning the next inhalation. This completes one full cycle of Equal Breathing.
                </dd>
                <dt>Step 8: Repeat the Cycle:
                </dt>
             <dd>Continue this rhythmic cycle of inhaling, pausing, exhaling, and pausing. Focus on making the inhalation and exhalation phases equal in duration.
            </dd>
