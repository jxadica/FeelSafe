            <h3>Steps for Sitali Breath:
            </h3>

                <dt>
                    Step 1:Find a Comfortable Seat:
                </dt>
                <dd>Sit in a comfortable position, either on the floor with crossed legs or in a chair with your feet flat on the ground. Ensure your spine is straight, and your shoulders are relaxed.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 2:Relax and Center:
                </dt>
                <dd>Close your eyes if you feel comfortable doing so. Take a few natural breaths to settle into the present moment, letting go of any tension in your body.

                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 3:Roll Your Tongue:
                <dd>Extend your tongue and roll it into a tube, creating a straw-like shape. If you are unable to roll your tongue, you can purse your lips, creating a small "O" shape.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 4:Inhale Through the Rolled Tongue:
                </dt>
                <dd>Inhale slowly and deeply through the rolled tongue, allowing the air to pass over the surface of the tongue. Feel the coolness of the breath as it enters your mouth.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 5:Close Your Mouth:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    After inhaling fully, close your mouth. If you rolled your tongue, gently rest the tip against the roof of your mouth. If you pursed your lips, close them gently.
                </dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 6:Exhale Through Your Nose:    
                </dt>
                <dd>Exhale slowly and completely through your nose. Focus on a controlled and steady breath, allowing the warm air to pass through your nasal passages.

                </dd>
                <dt>Step 7: Repeat the Cycle:
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Continue the cycle by inhaling through the rolled tongue, closing your mouth, and exhaling through your nose. Maintain a smooth and comfortable rhythm.
