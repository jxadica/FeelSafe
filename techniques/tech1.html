                Pursed lip breathing is a simple breathing technique that involves inhaling through the nose and exhaling through pursed lips. It is often recommended for individuals with respiratory conditions to improve their breathing efficiency.

            </h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    Step 1:Sit in a Comfortable Position:
                </dt>
                <dd>Start by finding a comfortable and relaxed sitting position. Sit up straight with your shoulders relaxed.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 2:Inhale Through the Nose:

                </dt>
                <dd>Inhale slowly and gently through your nose. Focus on taking a deep breath to fill your lungs with air.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 3:Purse Your Lips:

                </dt>
                <dd>Pucker or purse your lips, as if you were about to whistle. Keep your mouth closed, except for a small opening between your pursed lips.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 4:Exhale Slowly:

                </dt>
                <dd>Exhale slowly and evenly through the small opening in your pursed lips. Make the exhalation longer than the inhalation, allowing more time for the exchange of gases in the lungs.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 5:Repeat:
                </dt>
                <dd>Repeat the process for several breaths. Focus on making each breath controlled and relaxed.</dd>
