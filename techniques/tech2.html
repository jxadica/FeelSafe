                Diaphragmatic breathing is a technique that focuses on engaging the diaphragm to facilitate deeper and more effective breathing. This type of breathing is natural and commonly observed in infants, but as we grow older, stress and poor breathing habits may cause a shift to shallower chest breathing.

                <dt>
                    Step 1:Find a Comfortable Position:
                </dt>
                <dd>Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. You can place one hand on your chest and the other on your abdomen to feel the movement.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 2:Inhale Slowly Through the Nose:

                </dt>
                <dd>Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose. Focus on allowing your abdomen to expand as you fill your lungs with air. The hand on your chest should move very little.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 3:Exhale Completely:

                </dt>
                <dd>Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth or nose. Feel your abdomen fall as you release the air. Ensure a longer exhalation compared to inhalation.</dd>
                <dt>
                    Step 4:Repeat the Process:

                </dt>
                <dd>Practice this deep breathing for several breaths, maintaining a slow and controlled rhythm.
